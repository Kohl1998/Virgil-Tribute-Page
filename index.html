    <h2>
        Why I reasonated with Virgil
    </h2>
    <p>
    I loved Virgil simply because of the boundaries he pushed as a black man. He showed the world that we don't have to be any of the stereotypes such as an athlete, rapper, or drug dealer.
    </p>
    <p>
    Although, I have no issues with being an athlete or a rapper; it's just beautiful to see that we have more options to choose from as oppose to the stereotypes mentioned above.  
    </p>
    <p>
    Another reason I reasonated with Abloh is because he never allowed himself to be defined as just a 'designer', but as a creative that explored the world of skating, music, fashion, engineering, and architecture. 
    </p>
    <p>
    This was so refreshing to see as I have seen titles consume so many individuals in their careers.
